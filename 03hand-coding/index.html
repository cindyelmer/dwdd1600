        <h2> My Story</h2>
        <p>I began Flowerchild Floral as a passion project in 2021. After taking a beginner floral design course with
            <em>Andrea Seehagen</em>, the owner of the renowned luxury wedding florist company <a
                href="https://www.delaflorstudioco.com/" target="_blank">Delaflor</a>, I quickly fell
            in love with the craft. There's something deeply therapeutic about working with fresh blooms to create
            stunning arrangements—it's a form of soul healing for me. Even more rewarding is the opportunity to help
            people celebrate life's most meaningful moments by designing flowers that become part of their cherished
            memories.
        </p>
