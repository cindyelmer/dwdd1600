            <h2> My Story</h2>
            <p>I began Flowerchild Floral as a passion project in 2021. After taking a beginner floral design course
                with
                <em>Andrea Seehagen</em>, the owner of the renowned luxury wedding florist company <a
                    href="https://www.delaflorstudioco.com/" target="_blank">Delaflor</a>, I quickly fell
                in love with the craft. There's something deeply therapeutic about working with fresh blooms to create
                stunning arrangements—it's a form of soul healing for me. Even more rewarding is the opportunity to help
                people celebrate life's most meaningful moments by designing flowers that become part of their cherished
                memories.
            </p>
